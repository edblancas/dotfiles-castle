# Exceptions: Allow specific files/directories to be tracked

!/snippets/
# !/snippets/: This new line tells Git not to ignore the snippets/ directory itself.
# /snippets/*: This line then tells Git to ignore all files and subdirectories inside the snippets/ directory.
# !/snippets/: This final line explicitly tells Git to include all the contents inside the snippets directory. This is sometimes necessary for certain Git versions or edge cases when trying to include a directory after ignoring its contents.

# Keep other essential configuration files if you wish to track them.
# Uncomment the lines below for any files you want to keep.

# If you want to keep specific files inside subdirectories like globalStorage,
# you'll need to explicitly allow the directory first and then the file.
# Example:
#!globalStorage/
#/globalStorage/*
#!globalStorage/someImportantFile.json

# Ignore history and workspace storage as they are usually user-specific and dynamic
History/
workspaceStorage/
